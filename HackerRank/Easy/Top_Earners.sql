/*
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly "salary X months"
worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for
any employee in the Employee table.

Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as
the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings.
Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.
